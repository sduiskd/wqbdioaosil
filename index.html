                Think of your wife, think of your kids, think of your company.

Think about your career as a lawyer. 

Your options are simple, pay 5 bitcoin to the address above or we will be sending this link to  every email you ever interacted with. Friends, family, clients. We will send it to every single one of your twitter and linkdin followers, where they can view your shrewd penis and see evidence of you commit felony level tax fraud year after year. Your career and company will be ruined.

Aswell things like your entire families SSNs, IDS, Passports, and credit cards will be leaked, although that is the least of your worries.

As a final blow we will be sending the evidence of you committing tax fraud through various blockchain.com and Binance accounts, including your wifes accounts, to launder and hide millions of dollars, while claiming your income is negative, to both the IRS, FBI, and be making an 3949-A Report on you, in hopes we will be rewarded for giving the tip.

Be forced to pay millions in taxes, or pay 5 bitcoin. We have undeniable evidence your bitcoin address held over 50 bitcoin at one time.
